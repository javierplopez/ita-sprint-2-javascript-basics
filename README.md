# 📑 IT Academy - Sprint 2.1 - JavaScript Basics

JavaScript exercises collection developed as part of **IT Academy Sprint 2**, with the goal of practicing and mastering **modern JavaScript fundamentals and advanced concepts**.

The project consists of **progressive exercises** designed to strengthen understanding of core JavaScript features, from basic syntax to advanced asynchronous programming patterns.

---

## 🚀 Learning Objectives
- Master **Arrow Functions** and their syntax variations.
- Understand and apply **Ternary Operators** for concise conditionals.
- Implement **Callbacks** and higher-order functions.
- Work with **Rest & Spread Operators** for flexible function parameters and array/object manipulation.
- Practice **Array Transformations** using map, filter, reduce, and other methods.
- Explore **Array Loops** and iteration patterns.
- Handle asynchronous operations with **Promises & Async/Await**.
